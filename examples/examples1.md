Python program prints primes.
====
**Human**:
```
please write a python program to print prime number between 1 and 100
```
**ChatGPT**:

Certainly! Here is a Python program that prints all the prime numbers between 1 and 100:

```python
for num in range(2, 101):
    if all(num % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1)):
        print(num)
```
Explanation:

- We use a `for` loop to iterate over all numbers from 2 to 100.
- We then use an `if` statement to check if the number is prime. We do this by using the `all()` function to check if none of the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number (rounded up to the nearest integer) evenly divide the number. We do this using the modulus operator (`%`), which returns the remainder when the first number is divided by the second.
- If the number is prime, we print it.

Output:

```
